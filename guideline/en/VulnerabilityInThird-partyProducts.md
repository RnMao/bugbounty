Vulnerability In Third-party Products
====

## Vulnerability Overview
This document summarizes the vulnerability identification policy for third party products that are used in our products (services). When a vulnerability has been identified in the third party products, the vulnerability will be considered as a vulnerability in our product (service).

## Is This Identified as a Vulnerability?
Yes

## Points That Need Protection Against This Vulnerability (Scope)

### Basic Policy
- Vulnerabilities in third party products are not individually identified (for each CVE identification number).
- When several vulnerabilities are included in a version before an update, cases will be identified as a vulnerability if the corresponding fixed version is not in use.

#### Identified vulnerabilities example
Using ver 10.1.0 (included vulnerabilities 1 to 3) is regarded as a problem.

- ver 10.1.0 (version in use)
- ver 10.1.1 (version with vulnerabilities 1 and 2 fixed)
- ver 10.1.2 (version with vulnerability 3 fixed)

The response action our company should take is to update ver 10.1.0 to 10.1.2. In this case (although three vulnerabilities have been fixed), the three vulnerabilities are combined together as one identified vulnerability.
