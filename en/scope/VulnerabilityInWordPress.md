Vulnerability In WordPress
====

## Vulnerability Overview
This document summarizes the vulnerability identification policy for WordPress, which is used for our homepage. When a vulnerability has been identified in WordPress, the vulnerability will be considered as a vulnerability in our homepage.

## Is This Identified as a Vulnerability?
Yes

## Points That Need Protection Against This Vulnerability (Scope)
### Basic Policy

- Vulnerabilities in WordPress are not individually identified (for each CVE identification number).
- When several vulnerabilities are included in a version before an update, cases will be identified as a vulnerability if the corresponding fixed version is not in use.

#### Identified vulnerabilities example
Using ver 4.7.1 (included vulnerabilities 1 to 3) is regarded as a problem.

- ver 4.7.1 (version in use)
- ver 4.7.2 (version with vulnerabilities 1 and 2 fixed)
- ver 4.7.3 (version with vulnerability 3 fixed)

The response action our company should take is to update ver 4.7.1 to 4.7.3. In this case (although three vulnerabilities have been fixed), the three vulnerabilities are combined together as one identified vulnerability.

### Identification Timing
When a WordPress vulnerability information is disclosed (including security update information), our company will check the impact and fix the issue within two weeks. After our check and fix is complete, we will only identify unknown vulnerabilities that may have a negative influence.

Note: We will update our system as necessary according to the severity. However, we set the maximum update period to two weeks.

This is because of the following reasons:

- For WordPress, which is used for our homepage, we collect security update information internally and prompt in-house updates of WordPress.
- We will identify vulnerabilities that we have not collected.
- A certain period of time is required for any update in regard to WordPress vulnerabilities (including determining whether an update is possible).

### When Using the Cybozu Bug Bounty Program to Report Vulnerabilities

- The following two criteria must be met for us to identify a vulnerability:

- You must inform us that you are using the version of our homepage in which vulnerability resides.
- You must send a proof of concept for the attack detailing a vulnerability that cannot be protected against by merely updating to the latest version.
  - Examples of vulnerabilities that cannot be protected against by merely updating to the latest version:
    - The WordPress Foundation has not released a fixed version
    - Setup is incorrect, etc.

#### Tip
- When you report a vulnerability for third party products that are used for our products, refer to the following link:
