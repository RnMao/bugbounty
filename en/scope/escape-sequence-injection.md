## Vulnerability Overview
This vulnerability allows an unintended process to be executed when a file into which malicious escape sequences are injected is opened in terminal emulators.
This vulnerability may be exploited depending on how the terminal emulator handles escape sequences.
## Is This Identified as a Vulnerability?
No
## Reason This Is Not Identified as a Vulnerability
We consider that this behavior is caused by the implementation of terminal emulators.  
Therefore, we do not identify this case as a vulnerability.
